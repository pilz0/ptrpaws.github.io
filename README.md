# Jekyll Blog

Simple and minimal Jekyll blog. 
Forked from [Asko](https://github.com/manuelmazzuola/asko).
Inspired from [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise)

Both had some issues with Github Pages, so I decided to make it work by losing as few features as possible.
Now easly deployable on Github Pages, with:

### Features

[ ]Responsive Design
[ ] Dark/Ligh theme
[ ] Inline CSS

[ ] 404 page
[ ] Robots.txt

[ ] Ultra fast (Only ~5kb of CSS)
[ ] PageSpeed and w3Validator tests PASSED!
