# Gesko

Simple and minimal Jekyll blog. 
Forked from [Asko](https://github.com/manuelmazzuola/asko).
Inspired from [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise)

Both had some issues with Github Pages, so I decided to make it work by losing as few features as possible.
Now easly deployable on Github Pages, with:

### Features

- [x] Responsive Design
- [x] Dark/Ligh theme
- [x] Inline CSS
- [x] Anchor headings
- [x] Tags & Tag pages
- [x] 404 page
- [x] Robots.txt
- [x] Atom & Json feeds
- [x] Sass
- [x] Ultra fast (Only ~5kb of CSS)
- [x] PageSpeed and w3Validator tests PASSED!
- [x] Search bar


## Backlogs

- [ ] Improve SEO score on [Lighthouse](lighthouse_test.png)
