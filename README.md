# Jekyll Blog

Simple and minimal Jekyll blog. 
Forked from [Asko](https://github.com/manuelmazzuola/asko).
Inspired from [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise)

Both had some issues with Github Pages, so I decided to make it work by losing as few features as possible.
Now easly deployable on Github Pages, with:

### Features



## Backlogs

- [ ] Improve SEO score on [Lighthouse](lighthouse_test.png) 
- [ ] Next & Previous Post


## Installation

Run local server:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/P0WEX/P0WEX.github.io.git
$ cd P0WEX.github.io

$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Navigate to `localhost:4000`. You're Welcome, Fork and be Stargazer.
